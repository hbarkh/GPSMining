# GPSMining
Scripts written by me to enable research at REACTLab under the supervision of Dr.Bigazzi for crowdsourcing elevation data from GPS workout traces. The data mining involved finding public workout traces, using time zones to infer location, sampling a workout, and retrieving all workouts by a user that fell within our target geography (Vancouver). No official API was used, and I wrote custom code to automatically defeat captchas.
